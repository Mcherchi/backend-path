## **Main Goal**

At the end of this path, you will be able to build a **Calculator** , just using APIs.
Additionally, you will earn the knowledge about protocols, HTTP, DNS, REST and JSON APIs.

## **Step 2** - Build the Project!

# Calculator with APIs

Reproduce a calculator just using APIs.

Create a list of endpoints to reproduce the operations of Sum, Subtraction, Multiply and Division.

Each API should:

- Accept a list of parameters within the body section
- Be called only with POST method
- Return the result of the operation, and provide an error if the params doesn't match the operation or the operation is not possible
